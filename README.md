# CSharpApps

C# basic applications. Mostly mobile apps that were made while in college. 

The ignore file is just to upload it, while I still have the full working files. 
- Note, they may not work due to this.
- UPDATE: I only posted the main files for the app that I worked on, while ignoring the rest.
