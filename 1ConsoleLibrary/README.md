# Project One By Connor Reed

## This a summary of the soultion for this project

- The first thing that it does is open the terminal in a window, with the display menu function running.
- Waits for input and performs the action assocaited with that after "enter" is pressed.
- Will either open the whole libaray/ take you to check out a book/ take you to check in a book/ exit libaray
	- The libaray is taken from a JSON file.
	- Checking in or out, you enter the ISBN and press enter and it will change
	- When exiting the labaray, it will save all the changes to the JSON file.
