## Bit Operator by Connor Reed
___

This project builds a understanding of bit logic combined with event handling. With the 2 switches that represent a bit and its value, on or off, this app performs 3 different operations on them. ANDing, ORing, or Adding.
___
### View
- There are 2 horizontal stacklayouts and 3 vertical stacklayouts for different operations on bits
	- One that is the header and tells what the app is supposed to do
	- One below has the switches in it that represent the bits
	- The 3 vertical ones show different values depending on the event that triggers

### Control
- Switches
    - Bit one (switches on) default is off
    - Bit two (switches on) default is off

### Events
- Toggled switches
	- Once one is switched on, it assighs a bit value to that spot
	- Uses simple logic and displays what the binary value for each box
